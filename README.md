- Shown above are the results from the 2017 and 2018 stock trends. In 2017 TERP is the only company to have a drop in overall returns. All other companies made a good profit, the top best ones are DQ, ENPH and SEDG. In 2018, all the stocks experienced a drop in the market, except ENPH and RUN. 

- For code, three output arrays were created; tickerVolumes as Long data type, tickerStartingPrice and tickerEndingPrice as Single data types. 

### ***Summary***
   #### Advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code in general
- Advantages of refactoring in general is that second time around the code works more efficiently. Also, it takes fewer steps and uses less memory and makes it easier for future users. 

- Disadvantages of refactoring code are investing more time and also sometimes it might be hard to find ways to make an already established code work more efficient. 

   #### Advantages and disadvantages of the original and refactored VBA script

- *Original VBA Script* has an advantage of having the code from scratch and a disadvantage might be the chances of making mistakes throughout and debugging them. 

- *Refactored VBA Script* has an advantage of having the original code already, just requires a little manipulation to produce more efficient outcome. A disadvantage might be time consumption.
